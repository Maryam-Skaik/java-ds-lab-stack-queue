# ✅ Assignment Solutions – Stack & Queue Module

This folder contains **model solutions** for Stack & Queue assignments in the Java DS Lab.

📌 Solutions are released after the semester for revision and self-study.

## 📚 Problems Covered

1️⃣ Reverse first k elements of a queue (with recursion option)  
2️⃣ Delete k-th element from top of a stack (recursive)  
3️⃣ Compare two stacks without modifying them (recursive)  
4️⃣ Check if a queue is palindrome  
5️⃣ Sum top k elements of a stack (recursive)  
6️⃣ Find the maximum element in a stack (recursive)

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

- Understand LIFO and FIFO behavior
- Apply recursion on stack/queue structures
- Restore data after processing
- Develop problem-solving for intermediate DS tasks

---

## ⚠️ Notes

- Recursive versions provided wherever possible
- Students should trace recursion manually for learning
- Stack and queue operations are implemented with linked lists
